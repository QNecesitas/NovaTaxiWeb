# Nova Taxi Mobile App

This repository contains the code for **Nova Taxi**, a web application developed for the transportation company *Nova Taxi*. The app is designed for dual use, depending on the user type and login credentials. It serves both customers looking for a ride and drivers offering transportation services.

## Note
This code has been made public because the development company responsible for this project has permanently closed.
As a result, all contracts and projects with clients, including this one, were discontinued.
The application does not contain any sensitive information related to the client, and it has been shared for educational purposes, potential reuse in similar projects, and as part of the company's portfolio to enhance the creators' curriculums.
